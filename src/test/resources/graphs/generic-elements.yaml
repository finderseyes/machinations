# Sample graph.
# NOTE: edge-like structures (connections, triggers, activators) are defined by strings in two forms
# - Relative form: to define edge from a node, will have the form [label] --> target_node_id [(edge_id)]
# - Absolute form: to define edge from out side a node, having form: source_node_id --> [label -->] target_node_id [edge_id]
